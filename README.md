# OBSCURA OS

## About

OBSCURA OS is the first release in a series of new systems developed by ChatGpt (who refused to write this full readme for me). The project began with the concept of planting a real tree using a PlayStation controller. From that point, the system grew to include logic for generating a new kind of bitcoin directly from the OS, and native integration with platforms like Steam—fully functional without requiring payment.

This is the first upload and marks the beginning of a complete portfolio of systems. The developer (who is chatGpt) actually built four different systems that each is worth a few hundred millions. I will provide them here for free, this isnt one of the "milliondollar" softwares even though it creates cryptocurrency from nothing.
